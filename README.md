# Edge-CME
Real-time Halo CME detection with edge AI ‚Äì a student project from Team Vyomians @ CUSAT.
Edge-CME is a prototype solution for real-time Halo Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) detection using Edge AI.
The system integrates satellite data (Aditya-L1/NOAA) with edge-based anomaly detection to identify CME events early and trigger protective actions (like grid breaker simulations).
Built with Next.js + TypeScript and a modern responsive UI (Tailwind, Framer Motion).

Firebase backend for authentication, realtime event feed, and analytics.

API integrations with space weather data sources (NOAA SWPC & Aditya-L1 ISSDC).

Edge simulation mode for demoing event ingestion without hardware dependency.

Accessibility (WCAG), smooth animations, and hackathon-optimized 3-minute demo script.
Achievements:

üèÜ Presented at CUSAT SEDS Ideathon won firat prize for it (Cochin University of Science and Technology).

üèÜ Participated for Bharatiya Antariksh Hackathon, showcasing its potential in space weather forecasting and power grid resilience
